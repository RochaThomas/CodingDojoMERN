starting with empty project folder

created a server folder
put all backend in server folder
server.js controllers config models and routes

need to install cors
require cors in server.js file
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
this tells the server to accept any request

create a react app folder named client parallel to server folder

in client 
install axios and maybe react router dom if you need it 
now you can start your client react server

you can now have both servers runnning in two separate terminals
one running mongodb and one running react

where ever you are running axios methods you need to put http://localhost:8000/ <- some server route look in your server routes file
